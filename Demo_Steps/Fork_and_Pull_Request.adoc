== 2. Fork and Pull Request

=== 2.1 Forking the Repository
Fork my `Github_Collaboration_Demo` repository so that students can practice independently.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/cty20010831/Github_Collaboration_Demo.git <repo_name>
----

=== 2.2 Setting Up Local Forked Repository (Optional)
If you choose to work with a local version of your forked repository, remember to **push and pull changes** between your local fork and the forked repository on origin.

[source,bash]
----
git remote add upstream https://github.com/cty20010831/Github_Collaboration_Demo.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
----

=== 2.3 Committing Changes in the Forked Repository
After making changes, commit and push:

[source,bash]
----
git add <file_name>
git commit -m "Commit message"
git push origin main
----

=== 2.4 Opening a Pull Request
You can open a pull request in two ways:
1. Click the **"Contribute"** button on GitHub.
2. Click the **"Pull Request"** button in the repository.

Both options open the pull request creation window.

=== 2.5 Creating the Pull Request
Once the pull request window is open:
1. Provide a **clear description** of the changes made.
2. Select the appropriate **base and compare branches**.
3. Click **"Create Pull Request"**.

=== 2.6 Awaiting Response from the Repository Owner
Once submitted, the repository owner will review the request and either **accept** or **decline** it.

****
âš  **Please do not actually send me the pull request!** This is just for practice.
