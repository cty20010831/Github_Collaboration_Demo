== 1. Only Pull and Push

=== 1.1 Forking the Repository
Fork my `Github_Collaboration_Demo` repository so that students can practice independently.

=== 1.2 Cloning the Repository
Use the terminal to create two separate cloned repositories:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/cty20010831/Github_Collaboration_Demo.git <repo_name>
----

=== 1.3 Adding and Pushing Changes in the First Clone
In the first cloned repository, add the following line inside a Python script:
[source,python]
----
print("Simple Addition Program")
----
Commit and push the changes to `origin/main`:

[source,bash]
----
git add <file_name>
git commit -m "Added print statement"
git push origin main
----

=== 1.4 Making Conflicting Changes in the Second Clone
In the second cloned repository, modify the same Python script by adding the following line **under the function docstring**:
[source,python]
----
print("Please see the results")
----

Try to push the changes:

[source,bash]
----
git add <file_name>
git commit -m "Added another print statement"
git push origin main
----

You will receive an **error message** about diverging branches:
****
"Can't push refs to remote. Try running 'Pull' first to integrate your changes."
****

=== 1.5 How to Solve This Problem?
==== Option 1: Merge or Rebase Pull
Instead of a fast-forward pull, use **merge** or **rebase** style:
[source,bash]
----
git pull --no-rebase origin main
----

A **conflict resolver** will open in your code editor, allowing you to resolve the conflict manually.

**Side Note:** The following commands achieve the same result:
[source,bash]
----
git fetch origin main
git merge origin main
----

==== Option 2: Reset and Merge/Rebase
1. **Withdraw** the last commit:
+
[source,bash]
----
git reset --soft HEAD~1
----
2. After committing the change (without pushing it to `origin/main`), perform a merge or rebase:
+
[source,bash]
----
git merge origin main
----
3. A **conflict resolver** will open in your editor to handle the merge conflicts.

=== 1.6 Resolving Merge Conflicts
When resolving merge conflicts, you have **four choices** in the editor:
1. Accept **incoming changes**.
2. Accept **ongoing changes**.
3. Accept **both changes**.
4. Accept **none**.

Choose the best resolution based on the requirements.
