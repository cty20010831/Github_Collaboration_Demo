# Github_Collaboration_Demo
This repository serves as the in-class demo repository for Lab 3 of UChicago MACS 30122/30222 course. In this lab, I will walk through collaboration using git and github to help students better prepare for their final project. Specifically, I will mainly cover the three main ways of collaboration using git and github: 1) Only Push and Pull (on a Shared Main Branch), 2) Fork and Pull Requests, and 3) Branch and Merge. In addition, I will lay out some additional resources for both topics covered in the lab for reconsolidation and more advanced topics (beyond the scope of this lab) for exploration.

### Only Push and Pull (on a Shared Main Branch)

### Fork and Pull_Request

### Branch and Merge

## Learning Resources
I understand that using git and github for team collaboration may become challenging (and irritating ðŸ˜‘) at first, especially when you are trying as hard as you can to understand piles of unfamiliar git commands and those annoying "merge conflicts" error messages. This is in fact totally normal! It also applies to me when I started to learn these topics and apply them in my own group projects (and even today to be honest ðŸ˜‚). 

Hence, I have gathered a bunch of learning resources that could hopefully make our Git experience less overwhelming. These include both basic and intermediate-level materials that can serve as a refresher and aid in consolidation, as well as more advanced resources that could deepen understanding and provide hands-on challenges.
