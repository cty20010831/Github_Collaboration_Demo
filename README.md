# Github_Collaboration_Demo
This repository serves as the in-class demo repository for Lab 3 of UChicago MACS 30122/30222 course. In this lab, I will walk through collaboration using git and github to help students better prepare for their final project. Specifically, I will mainly cover the three main ways of collaboration using git and github: 1) Only Push and Pull (on a Shared Main Branch), 2) Fork and Pull Requests, and 3) Branch and Merge. In addition, I will lay out some additional resources for both topics covered in the lab for reconsolidation and more advanced topics (beyond the scope of this lab) for exploration.
